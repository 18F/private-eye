        <h1>Private Eye</h1>
        <p>Made by <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>.  Available on <a href="https://github.com/18F/private-eye/">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript plugin to warn users about links to private pages. Places a :lock: icon next to any links with any URLs that you specify as private, and gives a warning message.</p>
        <p>At 18F, this is used on public sites that contain links to internal content like private GitHub repositories or Google Docs. Rather than write two versions to redact those links, this allows us to publish new content and give a warning to both staff and external readers.</p>
        <p>Use <code>ignoreUrls</code> to supply all the private URLs. Any link that matches one of the URLs will have a lock icon next to it.</p>
        <h2>Demo</h2>
        <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, lick the other cats. Plan steps for world domination throwup <a href="http://so.me/private/url">a private link</a> while this is a <a href="#">public link</a> on your pillow pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space. Scratch at the door then walk away jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed scratch at the door then walk away so asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) so nap all day, so tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Stares at human while pushing stuff off a table please stop looking at your phone and pet me lick the other cats hide head under blanket so no one can see hunt anything that moves. Stare at ceiling poop in the plant pot, sleep nap for hide head under blanket so no one can see eat owner's food so lick the plastic bag. I am the best. Sit on the laptop intently stare at the same spot, so flop over hack up furballs and i like big cats and i can not lie.</p>
